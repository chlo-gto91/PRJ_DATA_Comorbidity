# PRJ_DATA_Comorbidity

I chose to work on comorbidities associated with pathologies (or chronic treatments or episodes of care) identified by the National Health Insurance Fund (Cnam). This data comes from an analysis in France updated in July 2023. The objective is therefore to analyze the data by better understanding the relationships between pathologies, preventing certain diseases, improving health care, or even contributing to medical research.

The pathologies and treatments are represented in the data as well as the number of affected patients, the impacted regions and various information linked to the pathologies.
